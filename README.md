# Stellar Networks

Stellar Networks is a pure-information oriented Starsector mod. It adds three
new intel tabs: Commodity, Market, and Storage. Each tab comes with its own
interactive board that can be used to manage presented intel.

## Commodity

Commodity board (formerly [url="https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=19383"]
Galactic Markets[/url]) is used to display buying and selling prices among all
known markets.

## Market

Market board (formerly [url="https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=19252"]
Hyperspace Networks[/url]) manages market searches. These can be either staff search
(e.g. freelance administrator, steady officer, aggressive mercenary), item search
(e.g. specific mod-spec or weapon), or ship search (e.g. pristine frigate,
d-modded carrier).

## Storage

Storage board (formerly [url="https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=18948"]
Stellar Logistics[/url]) displays all cargo and ships stored among all Storages.
It allows to display a unified view to quickly verify what is available, and
per-location view to find out where.
